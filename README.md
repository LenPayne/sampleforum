# Sample Forum Based on OpenShift Wildfly Cartridge with MySQL

This is a partial sample performing CRUD with jQuery and JAX-RS. It 
functions as a guestbook now, allowing people to post names and messages. To
turn this into a fully-functional forum would require the following changes:

1. Delete and Remove options
2. User login and tying accounts to posts
3. Threading of posts (ie- "reply-to")
